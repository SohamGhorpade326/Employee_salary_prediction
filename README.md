Income Insight AI: Predictive Income Analysis
A web application to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 using machine learning.

Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts income levels based on census data. It begins with data cleaning and analysis, moves to model training and selection, and culminates in a live web application where users can input their own data to receive a real-time prediction. The goal is to demonstrate a full-stack approach to building and deploying a practical AI tool.

Key Features
Interactive Web Interface: A clean and modern UI for users to input their demographic data.

Real-Time Predictions: The backend uses a pre-trained Gradient Boosting model to provide instant predictions.

Confidence Score: Displays the model's confidence in its prediction, offering more insight to the user.

End-to-End Workflow: Covers the entire machine learning lifecycle from data exploration to deployment.

Fully Deployed: The application is live and accessible via a public URL.

Tech Stack & System Architecture
The application is built with a standard Python-based web and machine learning stack.

Tech Stack:

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Joblib

Web Backend: Flask, Gunicorn

Web Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Deployment: Git, GitHub, Render

System Architecture:
The user interacts with the HTML frontend. When the "Predict" button is clicked, a JavaScript fetch call sends the form data as a JSON object to the Flask backend. The Flask server receives this data, processes it using the saved Scikit-learn pipeline (model.joblib), and returns the prediction and confidence score. This result is then displayed dynamically on the frontend.

Local Setup and Installation
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/income-prediction-app.git
cd income-prediction-app

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies:
The required libraries are listed in requirements.txt.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Train the Model:
Run the training script once to generate the model.joblib file.

python model_training.py

5. Run the Flask Application:

flask --app app run

Alternatively, you can run:

python app.py

6. Access the Application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Project File Structure
The project is organized into a clear and logical structure:

income-prediction-app/
├── .gitignore          # Specifies files for Git to ignore
├── app.py              # The main Flask application script
├── build.sh            # Build script for the deployment server (Render)
├── model.joblib        # The saved, pre-trained model pipeline (generated by model_training.py)
├── model_training.py   # Script to train the model and create model.joblib
├── requirements.txt    # A list of all Python dependencies
├── adult 3.csv         # The dataset used for training
└── templates/
    └── index.html      # The HTML file for the frontend user interface

Deployment
This application is deployed on Render using its free web service tier. The deployment process is automated through a connection to this GitHub repository.

The build.sh script handles the server setup, installing dependencies and running the model training script.

The gunicorn app:app command in the Render settings starts the production-ready web server.

Any new git push to the main branch will automatically trigger a new deployment.
